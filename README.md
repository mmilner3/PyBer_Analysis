# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview 
This project leverages ride share data around individual rides and cities to asses the different trends in ride share utilization over several months for different city types. By looking at Urban, Suburban, and Rural city types we can make business decisions to better understand if there are city types that make more profit per driver than others based on time of year. 

### Results

based on the above results we can see that Urban rides consistently top the total fare by week due to higher demand. However when we look at the fare by driver we can see that without this increased demand rural is actually the better fare per ride. This is likley because the rides are longer and stops are fewer. There are also fewer drivers in these areas meaning prices are likley higher. 


### Reccomendations
1. Run a promo in urban areas for longer trips to encorage fewer stops and higher fare per ride
2. increase the amount of drivers in rural areas to increase product availability in higher profit city types 
3. offer incentives to drivers to pick up outside of urban areas to offset potential costs to employees that may otherwise stay in their local area
